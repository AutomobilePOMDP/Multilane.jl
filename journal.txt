[X] check that lane_change is in lanes per second
    [X] what is y_interval?
         -  plotting is dependent on it - in plotting carstate.y*y_interval is the y location
        [X] why is there also w_lane? They are both 4. by default
        [X] Replace y_interval by w_lane? YES
    [ ] what should the lane change rate be?
    [X] get rid of rationality? I don't understand it, so YES
[X] plot histogram of time to lane
[ ] implement robust
[ ] split into generating problems/initial conditions and running solvers

[X] plot just the important ones
[X] get logsim over to tula

[O] rerun with new solvers

The policy is just doing really dumb stuff

Fri 24 Jun 2016 07:51:20 PM PDT

I want to be able to investigate a simulation
I HATE IPYTHON NOTEBOOKS
First, get initial conditions, then do test_run
But, if I want to examine the tree, I have to have the policy
so test_run should return the policy
should be able to visualize with that
PUT AS LITTLE CODE AS POSSIBLE IN THE DAMN NOTEBOOK

[ ] XXX Can't cars just speed over to the desired lane before any others get there?

Sat 04 Jun 2016 12:56:27 PM PDT

[-] Upgrade to dataframes
[X] Use heuristic policy
[X] Increase max lambda
[X] Fewer Lambdas
[X] Extract number of hard brakes
[X] Extract time to lane


Potential Caveats:
1. These numbers are not realistic (Chris and I don't know what parameter values to use)
2. We need a sophisticated driver model

Before quick crash test pruning: 4.7 seconds
After: 2 seconds (2 x speedup)

Fri 22 Apr 2016 11:26:08 AM PDT

Things to adjust:
[O] Cost function
[ ] Move crash testing from dynamics to action space
[ ] generate_sr tests for close calls

First thing to test:
[ ] Random policy vs MCTS with perfect state knowledge

Thu 21 Apr 2016 01:47:20 PM PDT

[X] test if crashed in state transition
    This give about a 2x speedup in rollout simulation, see scratch/simlog_faster_crash.md
