[ ] FIGURE OUT WHAT REALISTIC PARAMETERS ARE

Thu 23 Jun 2016 02:25:27 PM PDT

[X] Plot
[ ] Profile
[ ] Run Robust
[ ] Investigate bugs
    [ ] Crashes
    [ ] Run until lane reached

[ ] Travel Reimbursement

[X] Fix framework
[X] Run on Theresa
[X] Run on tula
[ ] Clean up
[ ] Graph

[ ] XXX Can't cars just speed over to the desired lane before any others get there?

Sat 04 Jun 2016 12:56:27 PM PDT

[-] Upgrade to dataframes
[X] Use heuristic policy
[X] Increase max lambda
[X] Fewer Lambdas
[X] Extract number of hard brakes
[X] Extract time to lane


Potential Caveats:
1. These numbers are not realistic (Chris and I don't know what parameter values to use)
2. We need a sophisticated driver model

[X] ADD CAR ID
[ ] DO MCTS EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T WORK

[X] NEED TO DEFINE WHAT LANE_CHANGE IS

TUE 03 MAY 2016 06:35:47 PM PDT

WHY COMPLICATED TESTINg?
what is idx in behavior model
change strings to symbols in cautious/normal/aggressive
lane_change meaning in action vs other cars
[X] Goals for tomorrow
    [X] Make decision about dynamics
    [X] ZOH acceleration - start braking assumption at 1g

[X] Read on the line of literature from the foundations paper
[X] define spawn model
[X] code spawn model

Sat 23 Apr 2016 09:28:51 PM PDT

Need to define
- encounter
- continuous time/ acceleration
- dvel_*ms*
- rationality

Fri 22 Apr 2016 11:54:49 AM PDT

Before quick crash test pruning: 4.7 seconds
After: 2 seconds (2 x speedup)

Fri 22 Apr 2016 11:26:08 AM PDT

Things to adjust:
[O] Cost function
[ ] Move crash testing from dynamics to action space
[ ] generate_sr tests for close calls

First thing to test:
[ ] Random policy vs MCTS with perfect state knowledge

Thu 21 Apr 2016 01:47:20 PM PDT

[X] test if crashed in state transition
    This give about a 2x speedup in rollout simulation, see scratch/simlog_faster_crash.md
[X] update reward
[X] update isterminal
